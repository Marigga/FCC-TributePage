      <div id="tribute-info">Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg was a German blacksmith, goldsmith, printer, and publisher was the first European to use movable type printing in around 1439. He also invented method of mass-producing movable type, the use of oil-based ink and the use of a wooden printing press that was similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period (and inspired by them).<br><br>
        In 1450, Gutenberg borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust (before the court case) and in 1455 he finished folio Bible which had 42 lines on each page. This Bible is today known as the Gutenberg Bible, “42-line Bible”, the Mazarin Bible or the B42. It was the first major book printed with movable type in the West.
        The Gutenberg Bible was printed in the black letter type styles, today known as Textualis (Textura) and Schwabacher, and in technique of justification. Illuminated decoration was added by hand and its amount depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated. The Gutenberg Bible provided the model for several later editions. Today, it is praised for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities and has an iconic status.
